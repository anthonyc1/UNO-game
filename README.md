## Download
To run this game on your local machine, open command line and navigate to where you want to save this project. Then run this command:

`$ git clone https://github.com/anthonyc1/multiplayerUNO.git`

## Run
For Mac/Linux users, here's a neat trick you can do on command line to compile multiple java files with a few short commands:

*Note: make sure you're in the directory will all the java files you need to compile*

`$ find . -name "*.java" > sources.txt`

`$ javac @sources.txt`

For Windows users, the equivalent commands are:

`> dir /s /B *.java > sources.txt`

`> javac @sources.txt`


And presto! You can now run the main file:

`$ java Uno`
